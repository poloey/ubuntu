~~~

## Installing nodejs in ubuntu  (currently i am using nvm apporach)
You have to install nvm after fully installing zsh shell. since it will add path to .zshrc file 
https://github.com/nodesource/distributions   

## Install nodejs with nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
~~~
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.4/install.sh | bash
~~~

~~~
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
~~~

~~~
nvm install 8
nvm use 8
~~~

## Wifi driver for ubuntu

## Handy terminal application ranger and tree for fun
~~~
sudo apt-get install tree
sudo apt-get install ranger

### Handy copy paste in terminal using xclip (only 16kb)
~~~
sudo apt-get install xclip
~~~
You can then pipe the output into xclip to be copied into the clipboard:

~~~
cat file | xclip
~~~
To paste the text you just copied, you shall use:

~~~
xclip -o
~~~
To simplify life, you can set up an alias in your .bashrc / .zshrc file as I did:

~~~
alias c="xclip"
alias v="xclip -o"
~~~

To see how useful this is, imagine I want to open my current path in a new terminal window (there may be other ways of doing it like Ctrl+T on some systems, but this is just for illustration purposes):    
Terminal 1:
~~~
pwd | c
~~~

Terminal 2:
~~~
cd `v`
~~~

### Minimize single window application on click
~~~
sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool
~~~
### If you need pair dependency you can run following command (It required when I installed vscode)
~~~
sudo apt --fix-broken install
~~~

### To minimize single window app click
functionality will be available `Unity Tweak Tool > Launcher > Minimize single window application on click`

### To keep terminal new tab in same director I have put following code last line of `.zshrc` file.
~~~
. /etc/profile.d/vte.sh
// in my case 
. /etc/profile.d/vte-2.91.sh
~~~

### To manage teminal credential
~~~
sudo apt install keepassx
~~~

### If I ever face grub rescue mode in dual boot ubuntu and windows. you will write inside `grub rescue >` console 
To know all available partitions in grub rescue menu
~~~bash
ls  
~~~
output might look like following    
~~~
(hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos3) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1,msdos1)
~~~

You can check appropriate ubuntu partition by checking them
~~~
ls (hd0,msdos5) //never put any space after `,`
~~~
Once you sure about right partitions you will do following. Let, in our case right partition is `(hd0,msdos3)`     
~~~
set prefix="(hd0,msdos3)/boot/grub"
set root="(hd0,msdos3)"
insmod normal
normal
~~~
Once you boot into ubuntu run following 2 command as well:
~~~
sudo update-grub
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
~~~


## Mounting
### exfat mounting in ubunutu
We can mounted exFat formatted External hard drive using `fuse`. We have to install following package
~~~
sudo apt-get install exfat-utils exfat-fuse
~~~

### NTFS mounting in case dual boot
first know the uuid of your windows partitions
~~~
sudo blkid
~~~
once you know the windows partition uuid open fstab file in sublime or any other editor. In my case I am opening fstab using vim
~~~
sudo vi /etc/fstab
~~~
added following line in fstab file
~~~
UUID=<UUID>    /your_desired_filename   ntfs   defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
~~~
`<UUID>` will be replaced by your own UUID which you have get by `sudo blkid` command. Save fstab and restart      

  I have having permission issue in ntfs file. I have solving this issue by installing `NTFS Configuration Tool` from software center. If you have `gprted` installed you have to uninstall it.
